    <!--Description of smoked brisket-->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> An american cult classic. A big chunk of meat, cooked in a smoky oven, and served to your whole block. What could be more American than that? 
        The trickiest part when it comes to cooking brisket is trimming it. The rest just takes lots and lots of patience and temperature control.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Two days before the party day, trim the excess fat off the brisket and coat evenly with salt.</li>
        <li>One day before, preheat the oven or set-up the smoker with indirect heat at 250F.</li>
        <li>Coat the brisket with a faint layer of mustard, apply rub, and place in cooker.</li>
        <li>When the brisket has formed a dark bark (it should look like it's burnt), wrap it in foil or butcher paper and place back in cooker.</li>
        <li>When internal temperature reaches 203F or the meat probes like butter, remove and let rest for an hour or two before guests arrive.</li>
        <li>Slice to serve. Can serve with BBQ sauce or any other condiments, but it really doesn't need much.</li>
    </ol>
