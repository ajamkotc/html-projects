    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb Spaghetti (avoid the yellow, cheap crap)</li>
        <li>300g Pancetta, chopped (or Guanciale if you can find it at your local Italian grocer)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs + 1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>500g Pecorino Romano cheese, grated</li>
        <li>(Optional) Red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <!--Preparation steps-->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook Spaghetti according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, place the pancetta or guanciale in a large, cold saucepan. Place on medium low heat and stir regularly.</li>
        <li>While the pasta and meat are cooking, whisk together the eggs and cheese to make the cream. Do not add salt, since the cheese is already quite salty.</li>
        <li>Whisk in a ladle of pasta water in the cream mixture. This tempers it so that it doesn't turn into scrambled eggs when added to the pan.</li>
        <li>Once pancetta has finished cooking, add in pasta, turn off the heat, add cream, and add 1 ladle of pasta water to the mix. Stir continually as the residual heat cooks the cream.</li>
        <li>Add red pepper flakes if using, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
